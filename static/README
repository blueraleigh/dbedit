======
These are the static files from admin component of Django 2.0.2.
They are unmodified except for the web font file names, which were
changed to lowercase. I also added the favicon directory and
favicon.png file. In forms.css I add the .submit-row p.copylink*
rules beginning on line 284. Additionally I modified autocomplete.js
by adding the getForward function and passing a forward param with
the ajax call.
